I'm Rafel Bordas, I'm interested in the intersection of Physics & Engineering based simulation and statistical & Machine Learning methods leading to Predictive Computational Science. I've started this blog as a way to help me interpret current papers and find connections between them and things I care about. Views are my own.

### Work

I'm currently Lead Data Scientist at [First Light Fusion Ltd](https://firstlightfusion.com). First Light is researching inertial fusion energy generation with projectile driven targets. I lead a team of researchers supporting First Light's simulation driven design work with machine learning and statistical methods. In practice that means lots of uncertainty quantification, emulators & surrogates, optimisation and model calibration methods applied to results from state-of-the-art multi-physics codes. I even do the odd bit of data analysis when the Experimental Team let me. 

Previously, I was at Emerson Exploration and Production Software working in the Tempest ENABLE team. My time working on ENABLE heavily influenced my views on how to conduct effective computational studies. I worked on various things including generating correlated, stratified, samples, Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods, Bayesian History Matching with emulators and Bayesian optimisation under uncertainty. 

Before moving into the energy industry I was at Oxford University. First for a D.Phil (PhD equivalent) in Computational Cardiac Electrophysiology with Prof. David Gavaghan, Prof. Blanca Rodriguez and Dr Kathryn Gillow in the Computer Science department. Second for a post-doctoral position in computer modelling of airways in people with asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease with Prof. David Kay and Dr. Kelly Burrowes as part of the [AirPROM](https://europeanlung.org/en/projects-and-campaigns/past-projects/airprom/) project.
